    </h2>
    <p>
     Hi, I'm Manraj Banga, a driven and passionate student at the University of Washington, pursuing a degree in computer science and software engineering with a minor in business administration.

     I thrive on solving problems through code and stay actively engaged with current trends in cybersecurity, ethics, and technology policy. My goal is to become a cybersecurity engineer, helping people protect their digital lives.
